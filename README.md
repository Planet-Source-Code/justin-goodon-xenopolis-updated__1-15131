I Take no credit for the game other than the additions i've made.

Original description:A strategy game where you have to manage your planet and make it prosper, you also have to defend it from pirates. You can also activate multiplayer mode and play with a friend across a local area network. Sounds have also been implemented. (They're horrible!) This game need a lot of improvement. =) I hope you will learn something from this code. Enjoy! =)
