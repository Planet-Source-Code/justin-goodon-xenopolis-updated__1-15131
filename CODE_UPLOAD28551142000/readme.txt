Things to come
==============
Here are a few things I'll most likely add to Xenopolis Version 1.02.

General features:
- More construction options instead of just soldiers and houses.
- Add build/train/research time so that you don't get things instantly.
- Ability to set difficulty level.

Multiplayer features:
- Able to send messages.
- 15 days needed for your army to return after attacking another player.
  (This will give the other player a chance to recover from the war)

change or add, or you have any questions,
